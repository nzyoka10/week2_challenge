# Weekly Code Challenge

## Content

This weekly code challenge consists of several tasks aimed at practicing various programming concepts in Python.

## Discussion

- Each task is designed to enhance your understanding and proficiency in Python programming. 
- By completing these tasks, you'll gain experience in working with data structures like lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets, as well as utilizing control structures like loops and conditional statements.

## Tasks

1. **Sum of Integers:**
   Write a program that accepts user input to create a list of integers. Then, compute the sum of all the integers in the list.

2. **Favorite Books:**
   Create a tuple containing the names of five of your favorite books. Then, use a for loop to print each book name on a separate line.

3. **Person Information:**
   Write a program that uses a dictionary to store information about a person, such as their name, age, and favorite color. Ask the user for input and store the information in the dictionary. Then, print the dictionary to the console.

4. **Common Elements in Sets:**
   Write a program that accepts user input to create two sets of integers. Then, create a new set that contains only the elements that are common to both sets.

5. **Words with Odd Number of Characters:**
   Create a program that stores a list of words. Then, use list comprehension to create a new list that contains only the words that have an odd number of characters.
